You might be aware of devices like Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone; these devices are categorised into single board computers, characterised by their small size but heavy computing power compared to a regular desktop pc (sometimes even greater). They are used in a variety of applications like NAS, edge computing, and mini pc. These boards cater to all your needs, you expect from a desktop pc, that too in a small size.



There are other siblings to single board computers as well, called SoM ( system on module). A SoM has everything a SBC has (processor, main memory, power and DRAM) except peripherals. The reason is modular connectivity to different carrier boards serving different peripherals. The other sibling is a mini pc. A mini pc is a type of SBC which provides you with a desktop PC experience in a small size and with similar computing power.



Now, coming to our main discussion topic on how to select an SBC. To keep this guide sweet and simple, let us first see the different components that a SBC is usually composed of:



The Processor: A processor is the most important part of your computer; it's the brain that efficiently handles your computing tasks to give you unparalleled results. A processor is selected based on several factors, but the most basic are its performance capabilities, clock frequency, data handling capabilities and available OS support. Most of these factors are listed in the benchmark scores of your respective processor. A basic comparison for the sake of understanding can be the immediate suffixes on the part ID of processors, which go into your laptops, usually ending with letters like U, H, P, etc., indicating their computing capabilities and power consumption. Similarly, for SBCs, you can see stats like cores and their architecture, threads, clock speed, maximum allowed memory, storage bandwidth and their respective data/transfer speed, number of peripheral ports.



The RAM: The RAM is an accelerator for your SBC. It helps in moving data at high speed for a short span of time. It usually helps your processor and storage to process heavy data at high speeds by storing data for a small time, giving the processor a fast read/write speed. Your RAM is the reason your games, browser, and music apps run smoothly. Your usual selection criteria for RAM consist of version, the voltage they work on, their transfer speed, and latency. DDR4, DDR5, DDR5L, LPDDR4/4X, LPDDR5/5X are some good examples.



Main Memory: The main memory is your non-volatile memory, which retains your data even after the power supply is cut. SSD, Flash Memories, HDD, and UFS are some good examples of main memories. Typically, you would want a large data storage memory for your application, but apart from size, you might also want to see replaceability, the interface it uses for communication, and its speed.



Networks: The number of networking options enables you not only to use the internet but also enables you to access your board from a distance without physically being near to it. A single board computer should ideally have Ethernet ( 1000 Mbps/1 Gbps/ 2.5 Gbps or greater), Wi-fi ( 5/6/6E or even better, 7!), Bluetooth (5.3 and greater)



Peripherals: Your application might want you to access input and output devices, or some interfaces for configuration and debugging or a typical sensor interfacing. Some good-to-go interfaces are I2C, UART, USB, SPI, JTAG, and I2S ( some boards also provide an on-board audio jack to access a digital audio interface). If your board provides an external PCIe interface to allow you to attach external NVMe SSDs or perform some expansion, it's a serious green flag!



Power Consumption: Though single-board computers are not very power-hungry devices, their usual consumption is somewhere between 5W and 50W. Some boards can also consume power up to 100s of watts! The importance of this information is to help you select a correct power supply unit for your board, in case your supplier doesn't provide you with one, which is quite a common case. Boards these days usually have USB-C PD for power supply to provide some ease to their consumers.



Expandability, Upgradability and available accessories: When you talk about upgradability and available accessories, you would want some external adapters or HATs to use some devices which are not supported in your favourable format but can be accessed natively in your processor. An example of this can be a PCIe or camera adapter. If your board provider designs HATs and other accessories, consider that a green flag!



Software support: Enough about hardware, let's not forget that software is also a necessary component of a single board computer to run your task efficiently, requiring less human touch and longer run. But what if you get stuck somewhere? Let's say the board is not booting or the image is not getting flashed properly. Who would you ask for help? That's where software support plays a vital role. A good hardware company also provides good software support. The more images your SBC is supported with, the merrier! Another sign is community. Sometimes when software support is busy somewhere, the community guys can run to your help. They may provide good guidance to you to resolve any issue.



Once you have compared all these specs stated above, you can create a small checklist of your own and easily come to a conclusion on how to select your next (or first!) SBC for your needs. Let me know if you need a Visual guide. I will be happy to provide that as well!
