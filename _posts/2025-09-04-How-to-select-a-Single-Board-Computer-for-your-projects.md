\# How to select a Single Board Computer (SBC) to cater your needs.



You might be aware of devices like Raspberry-pi, Beaglebone, Lattepanda, Radxa and many more. these devices are categorized into single board computers constituting to their small size but heavy computing power to a regular desktop pc (sometimes even greater). They are used in variety of applications like NAS, a computing device, a mini pc, your test board for robotics and automotive and sometimes for college and school projects also. These boards cater all your needs you expect from a desktop pc that too in small size. 

There are other sibling to single board computers as well, they are called SoM ( system on module) which has everything a SBC has (Processor, main memory, power IC and DRAM) except peripherals reason being their ability of being modularly connectivity to different carrier boards serving different peripherals and outputs. Other sibling is called mini pc. A mini pc is a type of SBC which provides your basic desktop pc peripherals on a small board size and similar computing power. 

Now coming to our main discussion topic on how to select a SBC. To keep this guide sweet and simple let us first see the different components that a SBC is usually composed of, and of course decides the computing power of a computer (a complementary word for SBC is computer, here):

1. The Processor.
2. The RAM
3. Main Memory 
4. Networks
5. Peripherals
6. Power Consumption
7. Expandability, Upgradability and available accessories.
8. Software support.   

Once you have compared all these specs stated above you can create a small checklist of your own and easily come on conclusion on how to select you next (or first!) SBC for your needs. Let me know if you need a Visual guide, I will be happy to provide that as well!
