\## How to select a Single Board Computer (SBC) to cater your needs.



You might be aware of devices like Raspberry-pi, Beaglebone, Lattepanda, Radxa and many more. these devices are categorized into single board computers constituting to their small size but heavy computing power to a regular desktop pc (sometimes even greater). They are used in variety of applications like NAS, a computing device, a mini pc, your test board for robotics and automotive and sometimes for college and school projects also. These boards cater all your needs you expect from a desktop pc that too in small size.

There are other sibling to single board computers as well, they are called SoM ( system on module) which has everything a SBC has (Processor, main memory, power IC and DRAM) except peripherals reason being their ability of being modularly connectivity to different carrier boards serving different peripherals and outputs. Other sibling is called mini pc. A mini pc is a type of SBC which provides your basic desktop pc peripherals on a small board size and similar computing power.

Now coming to our main discussion topic on how to select a SBC. To keep this guide sweet and simple let us first see the different components that a SBC is usually composed of, and of course decides the computing power of a computer (a complementary word for SBC is computer, here):



1. The Processor: A processor is the most important part of your computer, yeah it's the brain which handles all your tasks efficiently and gives you unparalleled results to whatever command you give it ( a processor basically takes input data and other commands using peripherals which we will discuss a little later) A processor is selected based on several factors but most basic are the performance capabilities, clock frequency, data handling capabilities and available OS support on it, most of these factors are listed out in benchmark scores of your respective processor. A basic comparison just for the sake of understanding can be the immediate suffixes on part ID of processors which goes inside your laptops, they usually end with letters like U, H, P, etc indicating their computing capabilities and power consumption. Similarly for SBCs you can see stats like cores and their architecture, threads, clock speed, maximum allowed memory and storage bandwidth and their respective data/transfer speed, number of peripheral ports (USB, Ethernet, HDMI/DisplayPort), etc.
   
2. The RAM: The RAM is an accelerator for your SBC. It helps in moving data at highs speed for a short span of time. It usually helps your processor and storage to process heavy data at high speeds by storing data for a small time giving the processor a fast read/write speed. You RAM is reason your games, browser, music apps runs smoothly. Your usual selection criteria for RAM constitutes of version, the voltage they work on, their transfer speed, latency. DDR4, DDR5, DDR5L, LPDDR4/4X, LPDDR5/5X are some good examples.
   
3. Main Memory: The main memory is your non-volatile memory which retains your data even after the power supply is cut. SSD, Flash Memories, HDD, UFS are some good examples of main memories. Typically you would want a large data storing memory for your application but apart from size you might also want see replaceability, the interface it uses for communication and it's speed.
   
4. Networks: The number of networking option enables you not only use the internet but also enables you to access your board from a distance without physically being near to it. A single board computer should ideally have Ethernet ( 1000 Mbps/1 Gbps/ 2.5 Gbps or greater) Wi-fi ( 5/6/6E or even better, 7!), Bluetooth (5.3 and greater)
   
5. Peripherals: Your application might want you to access input and output devices, or some interfaces for configuration and debugging or a typical sensor interfacing. Some good to go interfaces are I2C, UART, USB, SPI, JTAG, I2S ( some boards also provide on-board audio jack to access digital audio interface). If your board provides external PCIe interface to allow you attach external NVMe SSDs or perform some expansion, it's a serious green flag!
   
6. Power Consumption: Though Single Board Computers are not very power hungry devices, their usual consumptions are somewhere between 5W to 50W. Some boards can also consume power up to 100s of watts! The importance of this information is to help you select a correct power supply unit for your board, in case your supplier doesn't provides you, quite a common case to happen. Boards these days usually have USB-C PD for power supply to provide some ease to their consumers.
   
7. Expandability, Upgradability and available accessories: When you talk about upgradability and available accessories, you would want some external adapters or HATs to use some devices which are not supported in your favorable format but can be accessed natively in your processor. An example of this can be PCIe or camera adapter. If your board provider designs HATs and other accessories, consider it as another green flag!  
   
8. Software support: Enough about hardware, let's not forget that software is also a necessary component of a single board computer to run your task efficiently, requiring less human touch and longer run. But what if you get stuck somewhere? let say the board not booting or the image not getting flashed properly? Who would you ask for help? That's where software support plays role. A good hardware company also provides good software support. The more image your SBC is supported with, merrier! Another sign is community. Sometimes when software support is busy somewhere the community guys can run to your help. They may provide good guidance to you to resolve any issue.  
   

Once you have compared all these specs stated above you can create a small checklist of your own and easily come on conclusion on how to select you next (or first!) SBC for your needs. Let me know if you need a Visual guide, I will be happy to provide that as well!
