\# How to select a Single Board Computer (SBC) to cater your needs.



You might be aware of devices like Raspberry-pi, Beaglebone, Lattepanda, Radxa and many more. these devices are categorized into single board computers constituting to their small size but heavy computing power to a regular desktop pc (sometimes even greater). They are used in variety of applications like NAS, a computing device, a mini pc, your test board for robotics and automotive and sometimes for college and school projects also. These boards cater all your needs you expect from a desktop pc that too in small size.

There are other sibling to single board computers as well, they are called SoM ( system on module) which has everything a SBC has (Processor, main memory, power IC and DRAM) except peripherals reason being their ability of being modularly connectivity to different carrier boards serving different peripherals and outputs. Other sibling is called mini pc. A mini pc is a type of SBC which provides your basic desktop pc peripherals on a small board size and similar computing power.

Now coming to our main discussion topic on how to select a SBC. To keep this guide sweet and simple let us first see the different components that a SBC is usually composed of, and of course decides the computing power of a computer (a complementary word for SBC is computer, here):


1. The Processor: A processor is the most important part of your computer, yeah it's the brain which handles all your tasks efficiently and gives you unparalleled results to whatever command you give it ( a processor basically takes input data and other commands using peripherals which we will discuss a little later) A processor is selected based on several factors but most basic are the performance capabilities, clock frequency, data handling capabilities and available OS support on it, most of these factors are listed out in benchmark scores of your respective processor. A basic comparison just for the sake of understanding can be the immediate suffixes on part ID of processors which goes inside your laptops, they usually end with letters like U, H, P, etc indicating their computing capabilities and power consumption. Similarly for SBCs you can see stats like cores and their architecture, threads, clock speed, maximum allowed memory and storage bandwidth and their respective data/transfer speed, number of peripheral ports (USB, Ethernet, HDMI/DisplayPort), etc.  
    
2. The RAM: The RAM is an accelerator for your SBC. It helps in moving data at highs speed for a short span of time. It usually helps your processor and storage to process heavy data at high speeds by storing data for a small time giving the processor a fast read/write speed. You RAM is reason your games, browser, music apps runs smoothly. Your usual selection criteria for RAM constitutes of version, the voltage they work on, their transfer speed, latency. DDR4, DDR5, DDR5L, LPDDR4/4X, LPDDR5/5X are some good examples.
   
3. Main Memory
4. Networks
5. Peripherals
6. Power Consumption
7. Expandability, Upgradability and available accessories.
8. Software support.

Once you have compared all these specs stated above you can create a small checklist of your own and easily come on conclusion on how to select you next (or first!) SBC for your needs. Let me know if you need a Visual guide, I will be happy to provide that as well!
